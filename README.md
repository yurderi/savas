# savas
A release system built as a plugin for the ProVallo CMS

### Goal of the Project
An http-service which serves application releases.

A quick example:
You have an application which is based on electron.io

When it comes to release a new version of your application you probably need to do it classic: upload your files ftp, change the releases.txt to your new version etc

Using `savas` you can this stuff with ease and productivty in a simple web application.

Basically I use this system to serve updates for my electron.io applications and also for the ProVallo CMS.
